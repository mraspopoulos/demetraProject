# Description
THESIS vision is to demonstrate the ability and applicability of the millimetre-wave (mmWave) radio technology towards achieving high precision 3D positioning. mmWave technology is defining a new era in wireless communication by providing very wide bandwidths. It is currently being used in some Wi-Fi systems (e.g., IEEE802.11ad) and is planned to be used in 5G and beyond-5G communications in the near future as the it offers much more flexibility to use wider bandwidths and hence achieving much higher data rates and capacity. This very large availability of bandwidth, together with the use of massive phase array antennas that allow better time resolution and estimation of the signal phase could be used for achieving the desired high accuracy. Additionally, positioning research so far was mostly focused in 2D, however the 3D nature of these daysâ€™ smart applications is making the need for 3D positioning even more predominant. The project adopts a System Engineering approach to prove this concept/technology by developing prototypes and validating them experimentally in the lab.
In this context the project aims to contribute towards the ongoing research efforts in this direction to achieve cm-level accuracy. The goal is to validate and assess the performance of the developed 3D positioning techniques and assess their performance against set KPIs as well as the applicability of mmWave for this purpose.
